Perfect. Let’s walk through the end-to-end master plan for building, open-sourcing, and monetizing the Noesis Adaptive Learning SDK, assuming you don’t code — and that I will be guiding or handling the technical side at each step.

This plan is optimized for:
	•	Clarity of ownership
	•	Minimal personal overhead
	•	Strategic technical leverage
	•	Progressive output (open-core, monetizable SaaS, platform SDKs)

MASTER PLAN: Noesis SDK — From Zero to Global Infra

I. ROLES & TOOLCHAIN

Here’s what’s needed and how we’ll divide it:

Task	Tool	Who Does It	Why
Write + test code	Cursor.dev or Replit	ChatGPT (you + me)	Real-time AI-assisted coding
Visualize architecture	Excalidraw or Mermaid.js	ChatGPT (on request)	Clarity for APIs, components
Version control	GitHub	You (with help)	Public + private repos, collab
Deploy APIs	Railway, Render, or Fly.io	ChatGPT (guides)	Host orchestration modules
Package SDK	npm (web), Unity packages, CocoaPods/SwiftPM, JitPack (Android)	Me (automated)	Distribute per platform
Documentation	GitBook or Docsify + GitHub Pages	ChatGPT-generated	Elegant, dev-ready docs
Analytics dashboard	Retool, Supabase, or Next.js	ChatGPT-guided	Embedded charts + admin UI
Monetization infra	Stripe + Clerk/Auth0 + PostHog	Dev team (later)	Track usage, charge users
Product website	Next.js + Vercel	ChatGPT + you	Public-facing brand + funnel

II. DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

1. Build the Core SDK (MVP)
	•	Language: JavaScript + TypeScript first (most universal)
	•	Core modules:
	•	Attention estimator (via webcam or gaze APIs)
	•	Mastery logic (e.g., spaced repetition, thresholds)
	•	Basic telemetry tracker (time on task, events)
	•	Publish to npm under the @noesis/core namespace
	•	Host code + docs on GitHub
	•	Open source under MIT or Apache 2

2. Wrap SDK for XR (Unity C#)
	•	Unity plugin wraps core logic + handles eye tracking, head pose
	•	Build simple Unity demo scene for validation
	•	Export as Unity package (.unitypackage) + host on GitHub
	•	Add Unity-specific docs and examples

3. Create LLM-Orchestrated Tutor Layer
	•	Expose REST API via Noesis Orchestrator (hosted via Railway or Render)
	•	Integrates:
	•	GPT-4 or Claude for content adaptation
	•	Learner state input → next step suggestion
	•	Write logic in Python (FastAPI) or Node.js (Express)
	•	This is proprietary SaaS with usage-based pricing

4. Build Web & Mobile SDKs
	•	React / React Native wrappers
	•	iOS SDK (SwiftPM) + Android SDK (Kotlin + JitPack)
	•	Provide drop-in hooks: useNoesis() or NoesisProvider
	•	All wrappers talk to shared core logic and orchestration API

III. OPEN SOURCE VS. MONETIZATION PLAN

Layer	Open Source?	Monetized?	Format
Noesis Core SDK	Yes (MIT)	No	JS/TS lib + Unity plugin
Input Wrappers	Yes	No	Platform-specific adapters
Orchestration API	No	Yes	LLM-hosted agent + planner
Analytics Dashboard	Yes (Lite)	Yes (Full SaaS)	Retool or custom Next.js UI
Pro Add-ons	No	Yes	Flow-state detection, A/B engine
Custom curriculum tooling	No	Yes	Consulting / enterprise tier

IV. PRODUCTIZATION & GTM

A. Branding + Site
	•	Domain: noesis.dev or learnwithnoesis.com
	•	Static site built with Next.js, hosted on Vercel
	•	Includes:
	•	Developer docs
	•	SDK demos
	•	Whitepaper / vision
	•	API signup + billing (Stripe)

B. GitHub Strategy
	•	Create 2 orgs:
	•	noesis-open: open SDKs, plugins, examples
	•	noesis-dev: proprietary orchestration + dashboards
	•	Structure:

/noesis-core
/noesis-unity
/noesis-react
/noesis-mobile
/noesis-orchestrator (private)
/noesis-dashboard (hybrid)



C. Community + Growth
	•	Launch on Hacker News, Reddit, Dev.to
	•	Partner with edtech dev communities, XR hackathons
	•	Offer “Noesis for Education” grant or early access

⸻

V. WHO YOU NEED (Eventually)
	•	Founding engineer (CTO-type or lead builder for orchestration layer)
	•	Unity developer (contract or part-time)
	•	AI engineer (for model fine-tuning or attention scoring)
	•	Biz + BD (you or trusted operator)

Until then, I am the execution engine and can simulate each one, step by step.
