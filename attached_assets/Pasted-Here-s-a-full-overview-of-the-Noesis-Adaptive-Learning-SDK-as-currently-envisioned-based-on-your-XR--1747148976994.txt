Here’s a full overview of the Noesis Adaptive Learning SDK as currently envisioned based on your XR education stack plans, attention modeling goals, and platform strategy:

Noesis Adaptive Learning SDK — Overview

1. Purpose

The Noesis SDK is a modular, cross-platform toolkit designed to enable adaptive, attention-aware learning experiences across XR environments. It acts as the middleware and orchestration layer that bridges:
	•	Real-time biometric/behavioral inputs (eye tracking, head pose, speech, gestures)
	•	Pedagogical models (spaced repetition, mastery learning, flow-state alignment)
	•	AI-driven orchestration (LLMs selecting and pacing content dynamically)

Goal: Become the default infrastructure for personalized learning in XR by enabling any developer or educator to integrate adaptive learning intelligence into their content.

2. Core Modules

A. Input Layer (Multimodal Sensing)
	•	Eye Tracking Adapter (Quest 3, Vision Pro)
	•	Head Pose Estimator
	•	Voice Input + NLP Transcription (Whisper/local model)
	•	Optional: Pupil dilation proxy, blink rate, facial affect estimation

B. Attention Modeling Engine
	•	Real-time cognitive load estimation (based on gaze fixations, latency, micro-movements)
	•	Engagement detection via heuristics and optional ML models
	•	Dropout prediction for early intervention
	•	Context-aware task switching suggestions or micro-breaks

C. Learning Orchestration Layer
	•	LLM interface (e.g., GPT, Claude) to act as:
	•	Tutor (dynamic explanations)
	•	Planner (next task recommendation)
	•	Evaluator (Socratic feedback, memory probing)
	•	Mastery learning logic:
	•	Path dependency engine: unlock new modules only after demonstrated competence
	•	Spaced repetition scheduler: optimize review sessions
	•	Adaptive difficulty adjustment

D. Developer API
	•	Unity SDK with clean APIs for:
	•	Injecting learning content
	•	Receiving learner state (e.g. attention %, mastery %, frustration flags)
	•	Customizing thresholds (e.g. minimum attention to mark lesson complete)
	•	Web Dashboard (admin/instructor tools):
	•	Learner analytics (heatmaps, attention time per concept, mastery curves)
	•	A/B testing modules
	•	Flow-state detection + curriculum feedback

⸻

3. Target Platforms
	•	Primary XR Headsets: Meta Quest 3, Apple Vision Pro, (optionally Pico or Lynx)
	•	Development Environment: Unity 6.1 with XR Interaction Toolkit
	•	Cross-platform support planned via abstraction layers and Unity-compatible plugins

⸻

4. Open Source / Proprietary Strategy
	•	Core SDK (sensing + orchestration): open source (Noesis Core)
	•	LLM Tutor Layer: proprietary (Noesis Tutor), possibly hosted
	•	Attention Models & User Analytics: closed-source IP (Noesis Sense)
	•	Potential monetization through:
	•	Enterprise SDK licensing
	•	Custom XR curriculum design
	•	White-label deployment for schools or training orgs

⸻

5. Differentiators
	•	Unlike traditional LMS plugins, Noesis is:
	•	Attention-first: grounded in real-time biometric engagement
	•	Modular: can be added to any Unity-based XR app
	•	LLM-native: designed from the ground up to co-orchestrate with agents
	•	Flow-aware: not just reactive but proactively modulates pacing for optimal learning

⸻

6. Use Cases
	•	STEM education in immersive labs
	•	Technical training (e.g., surgical simulation, mechanical repair)
	•	Language learning with speech feedback + gaze-triggered comprehension checks
	•	Corporate onboarding or compliance in high-risk industries (aviation, pharma)

⸻

7. Long-Term Vision
	•	Position Noesis as the backend standard for adaptive learning across XR platforms
	•	Expand into:
	•	Neuroadaptive games (flow-state optimized)
	•	Cognitive rehab and therapeutic training
	•	Open educator platform to let teachers create adaptive XR lessons with no code
